# FoodRecipes

FoodRecipes is a web application built using Next.js 13, TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Apollo Client for handling GraphQL queries. The project serves as an opportunity for me to quickly learn Chakra UI and refresh my skills in Headless CMS development (Jamstack development).

## Goals

1. Gain hands-on experience with Chakra UI by styling the application using its components and design system.
2. Revisit Headless CMS development principles, focusing on utilizing Contentful to manage and deliver recipe content efficiently.
3. Explore GraphQL queries with Apollo Client, optimizing data fetching and management for a seamless user experience.
